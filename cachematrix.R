## Programming Assignment 2 - cached computation and use of lexical scoping
## Two functions constitute the functionality
## 1 - makeCacheMatrix - construct the matrix from and ordinary R matrix
## 2 - cacheSOlve - returns a cached inverse matrix as long as original 
##     matrix has not changed since last comptation of inverse

## The function, `makeCahceMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
## really a list containing a function to
##
## 1.  set the value of the matrix
## 2.  get the value of the matrix
## 3.  set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4.  get the value of the inverse matrix
##
## The matrix is assumed to be quadratic & invertible

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
        
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrixr"
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
## inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
## cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
## the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setInverse`
## function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        i <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached inverse")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data)
        x$setinverse(i)
        i
}
